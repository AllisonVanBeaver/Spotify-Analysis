My dashboard finds a significant majority of top songs streamed on Spotify in 2023 have a high score in danceability and energy, but vary in acoustics and speech.

Using a dataset from Kaggle, I created a dynamic Power BI dashboard to track specific metrics (danceability, acoustics, liveliness, speech, valence, and energy) of the most streamed songs on Spotify from its inception to 2023. For this dashboard, I imported a custom glass morphism background from PowerPoint, created calculated columns and DAX measures, and inserted slicers to filter by date, track, and artist. To enhance the user experience and display the top songâ€™s cover art, I added HTML code into a DAX measure.
